       "[\"Very cute coffee shop and restaurant. They have a lovely outdoor seating area and several tables inside.  It was fairly busy on a Tuesday morning but we were to grab the last open table. The server was so enjoyable, she chatted and joked with us and provided fast service with our ordering, drinks and meals. The food was very good. We ordered a wide variety and every meal was good to delicious. The sweet potato fries on the Chicken Burger plate were absolutely delicious, some of the best I've ever had. I definitely enjoyed this cafe, the outdoor seating, the service and the food!!\",\n",
       " \"Six of us met here for breakfast before our walk to Manly. We were enjoying visiting with each other so much that I apologize for not taking any photos. We all enjoyed our food, as well as our coffee and tea drinks.We were greeted immediately by a friendly server asking if we would like to sit inside or out. We said we would like inside, but weren't exactly sure how many were joining us yet- at least 4. We were told this was no problem, the more the merrier. A few minutes later when 4 more joined our party and we explained to the server we had 6, he just quickly switched our table. I really enjoyed my serenity tea, just what I needed after a long flight in from Sfo that morning. Everyone else were more interested in the lattes for expresso drinks. All said they were hot and delicious. 2 of us ordered the avo on toast. So yummy with the beetroot... I will start adding this to mine now at home, and have fond memories for my trip to Sydney. 2 friends ordered the salmon Benedict- saying it was delicious, and their go to every time they come here. 2 friends had a breakfast sandwich- I'm not sure of the name. It did look delicious. Adorable cafe, friendly staff, clean restroomsVery popular with the locals. I plan to come back the next time I'm in Sydney\",\n",
       " \"Great service, lovely location, and really amazing food. Words don't do justice. We had the mushroom parm bruschetta and the loaded double double. Both were so tasty. Also love the Aussie black tea and a flat white. Wish I had more mornings in Sydney to eat breakfast there. Highly recommend.\",\n",

       " \"Ricotta hot cakes! These were so yummy. I ate them pretty fast and didn't share with anyone because they were that good ;). I ordered a green smoothie to balance it all out. Smoothie was a nice way to end my brekkie at this restaurant. Others with me ordered the salmon Benedict and the smoked salmon flatbread. They were all delicious and all plates were empty. Cheers!\",\n",
       " \"We came for brunch twice in our week-long visit to Sydney. Everything on the menu not only sounds delicious, but is really tasty. It really gave us a sour taste of how bad breaky is in America with what's so readily available in Sydney!  Both days we went were Saturdays and there was a bit of a wait to be seated, the cafe is extremely busy for both dine-in and take-away. Service is fairly quick and servers are all friendly. The location is in Surrey Hills a couple blocks away from the bustling touristy Darling Harbor.The green smoothie is very tasty and refreshing. We tried the smoked salmon salad, the soft shell crab tacos, ricotta hotcakes, and the breaky sandwich. All were delicious, well seasoned, and a solid amount of food for the price. A definite recommend for anyone's trip into Sydney!\",\n",
